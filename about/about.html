        <h1>Chloe Li</h1>
        <p>Chloe Li was the project manager of this project. She wrote the main narrative and developed the core game loop of the game. Some of the art was also done by her (Eleanor, Dylan, Creegan, Dr. Peery base layers. Yup, thank me for the super cool Dr. Peery art.)

        <p>Masiyah Devoe was one of the lead artists on this game. She created all of the maps (lobby and hospital maze) and created the tilemaps to import into Godot! (It was very, very meticulous…)

        <p>Janice Deng was a recorder on this project and helped with some of the coding. She helped edit the narrative, Game Design Document, and created some of the pixel art weapons.
